/*
The SystemController in your embedded system serves as the central orchestrator,
managing high-level system operations, interactions between various components,
and overall system behavior. Its refined responsibilities, considering the
integration with components like HardwareManager, ConfigManager, and the use of
patterns like Observer and TinyFSM, are as follows:

Overall System Management: Oversee the entire operation of the embedded system,
coordinating between different modules like HardwareManager, ConfigManager, and
any other subsystems.

System Initialization: Responsible for the initial boot-up process, including
initializing the ConfigManager to load configurations, starting up the
HardwareManager to initialize hardware components, and setting the system into
its initial state.

State Management with TinyFSM: Utilize TinyFSM to handle the system's state
transitions, such as moving between initialization, normal operation, error
states, and shutdown. Each state encapsulates specific actions and behaviors
appropriate for that phase of the system's lifecycle.

Event Handling and Dispatching: Act as a central hub for event handling,
receiving events from various components (like hardware interrupts or
configuration updates) and dispatching them to the relevant subsystems or
handling them directly if appropriate.

Error Handling and Recovery: Coordinate error detection and recovery strategies.
This involves receiving error notifications from components like
HardwareManager, determining the severity, and initiating appropriate recovery
or shutdown procedures.

Observer Pattern Integration: Implement the Observer pattern to subscribe to
notifications from components like HardwareManager and ConfigManager. This
allows the SystemController to react to events like hardware status changes or
configuration updates.

Command Processing: Interpret and execute high-level commands, either from user
inputs, automated scripts, or other external interfaces. This includes
translating these commands into actions or configurations for other system
components.

Resource and Power Management: Oversee the management of system resources,
ensuring optimal utilization and power efficiency, especially in
resource-constrained environments.

Logging and Diagnostics: Facilitate logging of important system events, errors,
and operational data for diagnostic and debugging purposes.

Safe Shutdown and Cleanup: Ensure a safe and orderly shutdown of the system,
including properly closing resources, saving necessary states, and putting
hardware into a safe or low-power state.

Design Considerations
Modularity and Flexibility: Design the SystemController to be modular and
flexible, allowing for easy integration with different system components and
adaptation to changing requirements. Reliability and Robustness: Ensure that the
system can handle errors gracefully and maintain stable operation under various
conditions. Scalability: Facilitate scalability, allowing for future expansion
or modification of the system with minimal impact on the existing functionality.
Efficiency: Optimize for efficient operation, balancing performance with
resource utilization. Testing and Maintainability: Ensure that the system is
testable and maintainable, with clear documentation and a structure that
facilitates troubleshooting and updates.
