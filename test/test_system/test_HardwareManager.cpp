/*
To ensure the functionality and robustness of the HardwareManager, a
comprehensive set of test cases should be devised. Here's a concise list of test
cases to support its functionality:

Initialization Tests:

Test successful initialization of all hardware components.
Test handling of failures during hardware initialization (e.g., a component not
responding). Configuration Loading Tests:

Test loading valid hardware configurations from a configuration source.
Test response to invalid or malformed hardware configurations.
Test handling of missing or incomplete configuration data.
State Management Tests:

Test the ability to accurately track and report the state of hardware
components. Test state change operations (e.g., enabling/disabling components).
Error Monitoring and Reporting Tests:

Test detection and reporting of hardware faults or anomalies.
Test the system's response to simulated hardware failures.
Resource Allocation Tests:

Test successful allocation and release of hardware resources.
Test handling of resource conflicts or shortages.
Performance Monitoring Tests:

Test monitoring of hardware performance metrics.
Test adaptive adjustments based on performance data (if applicable).
Interface Abstraction Tests:

Test the uniformity and reliability of the interface for different hardware
components. Test the interface's handling of various hardware operations. Safe
Operation and Shutdown Tests:

Test the system's ability to operate within safe hardware parameters.
Test proper shutdown procedures and transitions to low-power states.
Robustness Tests:

Test resilience to unexpected hardware behaviors or inputs.
Test recovery mechanisms from hardware-related errors.
Scalability Tests:

Test the addition of new hardware components to the system.
Test system behavior under scaled-up hardware configurations.
Integration Tests:

Test interaction with other system components like ConfigManager and
SystemController. Test end-to-end functionality in a simulated or real
environment.
